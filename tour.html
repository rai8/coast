        Mama Ngina Drive offers you a fantastic view of the ocean. You get to see ships passing while nibbling on freshly made cassava crisps with (or without) 
        chilli and lemon, and refreshing madafu juice from the local vendors.
        A very serene place to hang out with friends, family or solo if you wish
        . You will probably meet interesting regulars and strike up good conversation. 
        Great place to unwind and just relax. Just next to the Likoni Ferry terminus, the place 
        can sometimes have lots of people. Quite a number of traders selling assorted items. Great view of Indian Ocean. 
        During the low tide, you can go down the cliff to explore the ocean.<br><br><br>

        Fort Jesus is Mombasa’s most popular tourist attraction. The fort, located along the coastline near the Old Town, is a monumental piece of architecture that was built in the 16th century by the Portuguese. The fort has a museum that displays various artifacts from the era where Mombasa served as a transit point for the slave trade and commodities, 
        and which enjoyed regular visits by seafarers and the like.The water here is said to be too salty for domestic use.
Other than being a popular destination for local and foreign tourists, Fort Jesus is an important site for various research programmes.
        It hosts a conservation lab as well as an office.<br><br>
